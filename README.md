# Agrobot: Multipurpose Agricultural Robot

## Introduction
Agriculture is one of the most crucial industries, contributing to wealth, morality, and happiness. However, traditional farming requires significant manpower and expensive machinery for various processes. To address these challenges, we introduce **Agrobot**, an agricultural robot that automates multiple farming processes, reducing human intervention, saving time, and being cost-efficient.

## Features
Agrobot is designed to perform the following farming tasks:
- Ploughing
- Sowing
- Land leveling
- Fertilizing
- Irrigation
- Soil monitoring
- Crop monitoring

## Technology Stack
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino UNO
- **Sensors:** Soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, and other IoT-based sensors
- **Actuators:** Servo motors, DC motors
- **Communication:** Bluetooth module
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, MIT App Inventor (for mobile application development)

## How It Works
1. **Sensor Integration:** Various sensors are incorporated to monitor soil and crop conditions.
2. **Motor Control:** Servo and DC motors drive different mechanical actions.
3. **Arduino Programming:** The logic for the robot is programmed using Arduino IDE and uploaded to the Arduino UNO.
4. **Mobile Control:** A mobile application developed with MIT App Inventor allows users to control the Agrobot remotely, similar to a remote-controlled car.

## Benefits
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces the need for multiple expensive machines.
- **Time-Saving:** Automates several processes to speed up farming operations.
- **Reduced Human Effort:** Requires minimal farmer intervention.
- **Precision Agriculture:** Monitors soil conditions and applies precise amounts of fertilizers and water.

## Installation & Setup
1. **Hardware Setup:** Assemble the Arduino UNO with sensors, actuators, and the Bluetooth module.
2. **Software Installation:**
   - Install **Arduino IDE** and upload the provided code.
   - Install the MIT App Inventor-generated mobile application.
3. **Connectivity:**
   - Power on the Agrobot.
   - Connect the mobile app to Agrobot via Bluetooth.
   - Use the app controls to perform different farming operations.

## Future Enhancements
- **AI Integration:** Implement AI for real-time decision-making in farming.
- **GPS Navigation:** Enable autonomous movement based on field mapping.
- **Machine Learning:** Improve soil analysis and crop recommendations.
